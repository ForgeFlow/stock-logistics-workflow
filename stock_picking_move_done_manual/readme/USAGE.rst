#. Create a new picking and indicate products and quantities.
#. If you want to process all quantities at once, press the button 'Validate'
   on the picking. You will be able to confirm as usual, and the picking
   will be completed.
#. If you want to partially process the picking, set the done quantities you
   wish to process and then press the "Complete" check button on the lines
   that you wish to complete. The move will be completed, and if there were
   quantities pending to transfer, they will be proposed in a separate line.
   If you process all moves manually the transfer will be automatically set
   as completed by default.
#. If you want to complete the transfer with partially moved quantities you
   will be asked to complete it with a backorder or without.
